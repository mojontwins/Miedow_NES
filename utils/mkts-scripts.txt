======================================================

General commands:

Use these before you do anything, otherwise you must know that stupid scripts do stupid things.

MAPFILE out.h 			- Stuff will be output there
LABEL label 			- Use as suffix/prefix/infix in labels
CHAROFFSET c 			- Offset by this quantity in the MAPFILE.

OPEN file.png			- Opens a new file for reading.
PALS file.png			- Establishes this palette as active [NES]
PALS ABCD 				- Establishes this palette as active [GB]

Metasprite processing:

METASPRITE X0, Y0, WC, HC, OX, OY [FLIPPED|MIRRORED]

						- X0, Y0: where to cut (in chars)
						- WC, HC: rectangle size (in chars)
						- OX, OY: metasprite origin, negative is left/upwards.
						- FLIPPED: like genflipped.
						- MIRRORED: Use instead of FLIPPED if your sprite has the origin in the horizontal center.

Plain charset:

CHARSET X0, Y0, WC, HC [, MAX]

						- X0, Y0: where to cut (in chars)
						- WC, HC: rectangle size (in chars)

Plain row-ordered, 2x2 patterns tilesets

TILESROW2X2 X0, Y0, WC, HC [, MAX]

						- X0, Y0: where to cut (in chars)
						- WC, HC: rectangle size (in tiles)

Mapped metatilesets:

MAPPED X0, Y0, MTW, MTH, AW, AH [, MAX]

						- X0, Y0: where to cut (in chars)
						- MTW, MTH: metatile size (in chars)
						- AW, AH: area size (in metatiles)
						- MAX: max. metatiles to cut

More to come in the future.

Metaspritesets:

METASPRITESET X0, Y0, MSW, MSH, AW, AH, OX, OY [, MAX] [FLIPPED|MIRRORED]

						- X0, Y0: where to cut (in chars)
						- MSW, MSH: metasprite size (in chars)
						- AW, AH: area size (in metatiles)
						- OX, OY: metasprite origin, negative is left/upwards.
						- FLIPPED: like genflipped.
						- MIRRORED: Use instead of FLIPPED if your sprite has the origin in the horizontal center.
